# How to Beat the Algorithm: Cluster Analysis of the Viewership of DepEd YouTube Videos
### A Final Output for DATA102 Presented By:
* Latiph, Azee
* Miranda, Vince
* Pastrana, A.N.
* Wong, Hans


This is a set of notebooks detailing our Data Mining of the DepEd TV YouTube channel. We collected the data via an API and processed it. These sets of notebooks must be read and ran in chronological order, with each notebook being labelled a number (e.g. 1_, 2_).

1. The first notebook is 1_Midpoint, detailing the Background of the Study, Data Collection and Cleaning, and Exploratory Data Analysis. 
2. The second notebook is 2_Part A... detailing our K-Means Clustering process, with justification for the method and interpretation of results.
3. The third notebook is 3_Part B... detailing our method similar to the above, with the addition of DBScan Outlier Detection.
4. The final notebook is 4_Conclusions and Recommendations.

The notebooks require an internet connection as the API requires internet access, and reiteration of previous graphs from the Midpoint are used in later notebooks through a github URL.

Thank you very much for the term and Happy Holidays, Ms. Unisse!
